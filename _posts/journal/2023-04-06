I think the most important character of one person is that she doesn't give up easily. she keeps on pushing the stone to the tops even if the stone keeps falling down. 
this is called persistence and optimism. this is called life, an energetic life.
A life can be as mediocre as most people who see others and also themselves based on the other's criteria. they are static. 
if you find something that is valuable, you should really believe in yourselfe, even though that thing is not valued by others. 
in that way you are really contributing to the world.
