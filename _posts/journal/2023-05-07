there's a sacrificial element in maturation, right, you have to sacrifice the pluri-potentiality of childnood for the actuality of a frame.
one reason is it happens to you whether you do it or not. you can either choose your damn limitation or you can let it take you unaware when you are 30 or 
even worse when you are 40s adn  then that is not a happy day. I see people like this and I think it's more and more common in our culture because people 
can put off maturity without suffering an immediate penalty. but all that happens is the penalty accrues and thne it finally hits it just wallops you because 
when you're just 25 you could be an idiot it's no problems even when you're out in a job search. it's like well, you don't have any experience, and you're kind of clueless.
that's what young people are like. but they are full of potential. 
okay, well, now you are the same person at 30. it's like people aren't so thrilled about you at that point. 
it's like what the hell have you been doing for the last ten years.
the problem with being a child is that all you are is potential and its really low resolution you could be anything but you are not anything,
so you adopt an apprenticeship, and then at least you become something and when you are something that makes the world open up to you again.
part of the proper path of development in the last half of life was to rediscover the child you lest behind you as you were apprenticing and so then you get 
to be something and regain that potential at the same time
