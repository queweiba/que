The stone is falling down again.
it is difficult to hold it any longer. not one more day, not one more hour.
let it fall, to the lowest it can be.
then the salvation will begin. the light will break.
let's wait and see.

why does some people keep talking about themselves even when others don't even feel like listening to it.
why the people who talk the loudest is the one that gains more.

I don't need to really care those silly people. FUCK THEM ALL!!!
