I just don't regret or resent that fact that I maintain the way I am now at this age, a life-stage that is different from most other people.
indeed I didn't know how to love and how to communicate in my younger age. and how to express my feelings when I were upset. 
if I just started to a relationship irresponsibly, there would be a higher chance that I don't know how to love for the rest of my lives. 
because your life circle just wouldn't change and you would end up thinking this is the normal relationship you would have and all people all share just the same.
