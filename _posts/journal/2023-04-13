figures in the movie that are quite touching because they resembles something deep in our minds. 
a weak, sufferring and helpless character is the one who would think is the most authetic description of the our inner minds. like Pat Bateman in American Psycho,
who is materilized by the the society and totally lose his positive control to the world. 
and the ending where those kinds of characters finally find their way out would be thought as clich√©.
but is this really true?
where there's a will there is a way.
usually the will is the thing that is missing, so called learned helplessness.
if there is a will, then a way is not something that is so difficult to find.
