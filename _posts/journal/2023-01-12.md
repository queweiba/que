this is fucking so hard to start with. I have done nothing wrong, I am just not so good at making friends I guess. don't blame yourself too hard
this is going to trap me into a new negative loop. I cannot just let it win.
people supress the weak and praise for the strong. If I am strong, I will protect the weak and ask them to be strong.
