I thought that after going through some experience and people I will know how to face myself.  However, in the end, this has not been the case.
narcissium is something that we all shared to a certain point. and people are just so complicated. once you catergorize them into one group doesn't mean it is done, 
 and you need to constantly learn about people without stopping.

how to fill the inner-void in myself. the lack of motivation, perpetual studying of others is just a reflection of my lack of confidence. 
a long way to go, and lots to be done, to be finally able to see the world clearly, to finally accept the way I am. 

Interestingly, I feel more assured of who I am when I abandon the hope of trying to impress others. This frees me and allows me to feel calmer.
