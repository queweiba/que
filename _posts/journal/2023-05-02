I thought that after going through some things and people I will know how to face myself. but in the end, it is not-finished.
narcissium is something that we all shared to a certain point. and people are just so complicated. once you catergorize them into one group doesn't mean it is done, 
and you need constantly learn the people without stops.

how to fill the inner-void in myself. the lack of motivation, the perpetual study of other people is just a reflection of my lack of confidence. 
a long way to go, and lots to be done, to be finally able to see the world correctly, to finally accept the way I am.
