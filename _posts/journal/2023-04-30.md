My choice
I don't need to blame myself for the things or the person that I have encountered. I should rather take them as lessons.
I tried and am still trying to believe in the basic characteristics of human. although I doubted that a bit, I must still believe in it.
that's the stone I am holding. one of them.
I certainly need more courage than just self-blame and being more withdrawn than before.
I have survived in that situation and I should get more confidence in myself for the future.
